                            <p style="text-align:justify;">Digital screens, being those videowall, LCD or (O)LED consoles, more and more are being brought to the market in a wide range of varieties. Those screens however, exemplary are being developed for indoor usage. As with many new products, there was a huge consumer demand for indoor displays that drove the development of indoor screens. They just had to be altered for commercial use. There hardly has been consumer demand for outdoor displays so the demand has not been high enough to drive development, keeping many of the large screen manufacturers out of the market.

                            <p style="text-align:justify;">We started our outdoor solutions from a market question to develop legally allowed screens deployment in transportation. This challenge requires screens and peripherals development at a very high standard, bearing in mind demands like waterproof and shock absorption as well as far more strict agreements with governments. In the interest of bringing theory into practice, MovingMessage has undertaken this long road to approval canals of screens usage on the road and we are currently piloting these solutions with our market partners and the authorities.

                <h3>On shop</h3>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Digital technology is rapidly innovating every aspect of the retail industry, and in doing so, the gap between online and offline shopping is becoming narrower.   
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Colorful and even moving images on your (indoor) walls, behind the window or above the entrance of your shop, are a great way to not only recommend the latest sales, but moreover to enter with your messages into the perception of your customers. To tease and to seduce clients into your shop for more experience.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">Through making use of high quality, flexible content changing screens, we could augment your shop attractiveness in order for you to become a more appealing shop for your customers to visit and to ultimately gain better sales results.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite 76 percent of purchase decisions (and 60 percent of brand 'switch' decisions) being made impulsively at the shelf-edge, the power of the shelf-edge as a premium marketing tool can sometimes be underestimated.  
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Traditionally, static shelf-edges with paper-printed labels have been used only to fulfill one purpose – to inform customers of the price of goods.  
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">Fresh technologies such as electronic shelf-edge displays can be used not only to provide vital information, but also to provide a valuable, personalized and truly seamless experience for shoppers.

                <p style="text-align:justify;">We provide the consoles to play the information. Together with you, your advertisers or your advertisement agency, we organize your life feed messages. Content control, soft- and hardware maintenance are part of the deal.
